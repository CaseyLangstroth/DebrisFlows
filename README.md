this is a repository for the final project in Reproducible Data Science Spring 2023. The project goals are to take output data from GIS or csv files and clean the data for visualization, statistics, and further manipulation.
outputs will be from R, either as a csv that has been cleaned, or plots... i dont know what else R does.

gitignore will include: *.docx
				*.png (plots)
				*.Rproj
