This is a set of ArcGIS tools for valley width measuring in optimal locations.
It mostly fits basins including valley order between 2-5 (sensu Strahler).   
The algorithm is described in the Supplement of the article:
"Drainage reorganization induces deviations in the scaling between
 valley width and drainage area" by Harel et. al., 2022. 

To run the algorithm, first generate the required rasters with the
toolbox "1 pre_vbet".
Then apply the VBET tool (Gilbert et. al., 2016), which is attached in the folder "2_VBET". 
Finally, run the tools in the toolbox "3_post_vbet" in order, i.e., 3a, 3b..etc.
Each step produces outputs that are used in the next tool. 
The final output is “intrsct_pts.shp”. This is a shapefile with points generated along the intersections between the width transects and the channel talweg (flowlines). 
The shapefile table contains the coordinates, valley width, elevation and flow accumulation of each point.
